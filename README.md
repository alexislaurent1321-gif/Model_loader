# Presentation
This is a demonstration of the SCOPE library, a self-made beginner 3D engine. It allows you to load a model, add lights to it, and navigate through the scene.
It loads three imgui user interfaces: one for the model, one for the lights, and one for the camera. The project uses SCOPE as a submodule. 

# Dependencies and installation
After cloning the repo, add it with the command `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/alexislaurent1321-gif/SCOPE.git`.
